// create deck logic (not necessary here but future proofs for multiple card games)

- 26 possible values (black vs red)

For the dealer generate 1 random card

For the player generate 2 random cards


store value of dealer 
store value of player 

prompt player to:

	- Stand

if player clicks stand:

	- check if new total value <= 21
	- if value !=== <= 21 then generate new card
	- compare final value to player's value

if player clicks hit:
	- generate additional random card to player
	- check if new total value <=== 21
		- if value === 21 then show a win
		- if value < 21 then show hit/stand options
		- if dealer !=== player then lose
			- if player stands then generate a final additional card to dealer and compare values
				- if player clicks hit then generate an additional card to player
