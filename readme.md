Instructions:

	- Start the game by opening the webpage
	- The user's starting hand value is displayed as an alert.
	- Users can opt to hit or stand based on this value through the alert's "OK" and "Cancel" options respectively.
	- Results are returned via the console



Outstanding challenges:


	- Dealing a new hand requires page refresh
	- Results are returned via the console rather than visually
	- User actions aren't driven by button interactions


Nice to haves:

	- Visualisations of cards
	- Have a cash balanace allowing users to bet on an upcoming deal
	- Don't allow for an already used card to be available in the "deck"
	- Populate the win/loss stats
	- Dynamically populate available buttons based on game "stage"

Technologies used:

	- Javascript 5 for the game logic
	- HTML/CSS for browser operations
	- JQuery to drive game logic via browser
